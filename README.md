## Bank Account Simulator - Python Back-End Preview

### Overview
The Bank Account Simulator is a Python-based back-end system designed to simulate basic banking operations. It allows users to create bank accounts, deposit funds, and withdraw money. The back-end system uses Python’s standard libraries and a simple in-memory data store to manage accounts and transactions.

### Key Features
1. **Account Creation**: Users can create new bank accounts with a unique account ID and an initial balance.
2. **Deposit Funds**: Users can deposit money into their accounts, increasing their balance.
3. **Withdraw Funds**: Users can withdraw money from their accounts, provided they have sufficient funds.

### Technologies
- **Python**: The core language for implementing the back-end logic.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework used to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **SQLite (Optional)**: For persistent storage of account data, although an in-memory store is used in this basic version.

### Components

#### 1. **Account Management**
- **Data Structure**: An in-memory dictionary to store account information, where the keys are account IDs and the values are dictionaries containing account details like balance.
- **Account Creation**: Generates a unique ID for each new account and initializes it with the provided balance.

#### 2. **Deposits and Withdrawals**
- **Deposit**: Adds the specified amount to the account balance.
- **Withdrawal**: Subtracts the specified amount from the account balance, with checks to ensure sufficient funds.


### Future Enhancements
- **Persistent Storage**: Integrate SQLite or another database for persistent data storage.
- **Security**: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Validation**: Add comprehensive input validation and error handling.

This back-end simulator provides a simple yet effective way to manage basic bank account operations and can be expanded as needed for more advanced features and integration.
